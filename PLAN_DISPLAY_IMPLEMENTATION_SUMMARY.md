- Sample data with realistic media plans
- Multiple demo modes (comparison, analysis, export)
- Technical implementation details
- Usage examples and best practices

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 4.1 (Plan Display)
✅ Side-by-side plan comparison interface
✅ Detailed breakdown display showing sites, products, costs, and allocations
✅ Estimated impressions, reach, and frequency display
✅ Expandable plan details with comprehensive information

### Requirement 4.2 (Plan Comparison)
✅ Highlighting key differences between options
✅ Summary statistics and performance indicators
✅ Interactive comparison elements

### Requirement 4.3 (Performance Metrics)
✅ Visual budget allocation charts for each plan
✅ Interactive elements to explore plan details
✅ Comparison highlighting and analysis

### Requirement 4.4 (Export Functionality)
✅ CSV export functionality for selected plans
✅ PDF report generation with formatted plan details
✅ Save functionality for plan persistence
✅ Export validation and error handling

## Integration Points

### With Existing Components
- Integrates with `MediaPlannerForm` for client brief data
- Uses `DataManager` for market data access
- Compatible with `AIPlanGenerator` output format
- Follows existing `MediaPlan` and `FormatAllocation` data models

### With Future Components
- Ready for integration with `MediaPlanController` orchestration
- Supports fine-tuned model outputs from `ModelTrainingManager`
- Compatible with audience targeting enhancements
- Extensible for additional export formats and sharing options

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- Streamlit for interactive UI components
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Plotly for advanced charts (optional, with fallbacks)
- JSON for structured data export
- Python datetime for timestamps and formatting

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks for all operations
- User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
- Validation for export data integrity

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient data processing for large plan sets
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Session state optimization for persistence
- Memory management for export operations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Plan Display
```python
from ui.components import PlanDisplayComponent

display_component = PlanDisplayComponent(data_manager)
result = display_component.render_plan_comparison(plans, client_brief)
```

### Interactive Analysis
```python
analysis_result = display_component.render_interactive_budget_breakdown(plans, client_brief)
```

### Export Functionality
```python
from ui.components import PlanExportComponent

export_component = PlanExportComponent()
export_result = export_component.render_export_interface(plans, client_brief)
```

## Next Steps

The plan display and comparison system is now complete and ready for integration with the main application workflow. The components provide comprehensive visualization, analysis, and export capabilities that meet all specified requirements and enhance the user experience for media planners.

Key integration points for the next development phase:
1. Integration with `MediaPlanController` for complete workflow
2. Connection with the main Streamlit application
3. Testing with real rate card and site list data
4. Performance optimization for production use
5. Additional export format implementations (true PDF generation)
