# AI Plan Generation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented task 4 "Develop AI plan generation system" with all three subtasks completed:

- ✅ 4.1 Create AIPlanGenerator class
- ✅ 4.2 Implement budget optimization and allocation logic  
- ✅ 4.3 Add plan parsing and validation

## Components Implemented

### 1. AIPlanGenerator (`business_logic/ai_plan_generator.py`)

**Key Features:**
- OpenAI API integration with proper error handling and retry logic
- Dynamic system prompt generation based on market data and constraints
- Generates exactly 3 distinct media plan options
- Plan diversity algorithms to ensure strategic differences
- Support for fine-tuned models
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures

**Methods:**
- `generate_multiple_plans()` - Main plan generation workflow
- `create_system_prompt()` - Dynamic prompt engineering
- `optimize_plan_diversity()` - Ensures plan variety
- `use_fine_tuned_model()` - Switch between base and fine-tuned models

### 2. BudgetOptimizer (`business_logic/budget_optimizer.py`)

**Key Features:**
- Multiple optimization strategies (reach, frequency, balanced, cost-efficient, high-impact)
- Budget distribution algorithms across selected formats
- Reach optimization and frequency capping considerations
- Diverse media mix logic for larger budgets
- High-impact placement prioritization for limited budgets

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Reach-Focused**: Maximizes unique audience coverage
- **Frequency-Focused**: Concentrates budget for deeper engagement
- **Balanced**: Optimizes across multiple metrics
- **Cost-Efficient**: Maximizes impressions per dollar
- **High-Impact**: Prioritizes premium formats

### 3. PlanValidator (`business_logic/plan_validator.py`)

**Key Features:**
- Robust JSON parsing with error recovery
- Structured data extraction from AI responses
- Budget constraint validation
- Impression calculation verification
- Format availability validation
- Plan diversity checking
- Comprehensive error reporting with severity levels

**Validation Capabilities:**
- Required field validation
- Budget overage detection
- CPM reasonableness checks
- Impression calculation verification
- Format availability validation
- Plan similarity detection

### 4. MediaPlanController (`business_logic/media_plan_controller.py`)

**Key Features:**
- Orchestrates complete media planning workflow
- Input validation and sanitization
- Plan comparison and ranking logic
- Site recommendation enhancement
- System status monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling

**Main Workflow:**
1. Validate data availability
2. Get market-specific data
3. Generate AI plans
4. Validate generated plans
5. Enhance with site recommendations
6. Perform final quality checks
